    <h3>Portrait of Dr. Gachet</h3>
    <p>Portrait of Dr. Gachet was sold for $82.5 million all the way back in 1990, which makes it worth almost double the price in today’s money!

Gachet was the person who took care of van Gogh during the last few months of his life.</p>
    <h3><a href="rabbit.html">Rabbit</a></h3>
    <p>Rabbit isn’t a painting, it’s a 3-foot stainless steel sculpture, but it sold for $91.1 million in 2019. It was made by Jeff Koons in 1986. This sculpture is significant because it’s the most expensive artwork sold by a living artist at an auction. </p>
