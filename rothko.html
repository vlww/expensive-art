   <h3>Career Beginnings</h3>
    <p>During Mark Rothko’s early career, he was visiting a friend in the Art Students League of New York, while he was there, he noticed some of the students sketching a model, which started his career as an artist. In a response to World War 2, he started experimenting with different themes such as surrealism to express the tragedy of the war. </p>
    <h3>Art Styles</h3>
    <p>In 1943, Mark had a divorce with his wife Edith Sachar, this led him into a spiraling depression, which led to him changing his art style from surrealism to “”multiform”. Multiform is what signified his transition to a more mature  abstract style. His style switched to a more simple style, he created his own art movement with simplified shapes, and is known as an “abstract expressionist”.</p>
