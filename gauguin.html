    <h3>Early life</h3>
    <p>Paul Gauguin was a French post-impressionist artist. He was born in Paris on June 7th, 1848. At the age of 11 he went to multiple public schools, and eventually stayed at a Catholic boarding school for 3 years. He joined the navy, and he served for 2 years. Unfortunately, his mother died on July 7th, 1867, but he never knew until his sister Marie sent him a note about it. </p>
    <h3>Career beginnings</h3>
    <p>Gauguin would paint in his free time, and he would also go to art galleries to buy different pieces of art. During the market crash, nobody wanted to spend money on Gauguin's art, and then for the next 2 years he slowly became a full-time artist. Gauguin's work slowly changed into a cloisonnism style, which is painting with flat areas of color, but with bold outlines. </p>

    <h3>Tahiti</h3>
    <p>Paul Gaugin is famous for the painting Nafea Faa Ipoipo, also known as When Will You Marry?. This art piece is now worth 229 million dollars. Gaugin had traveled to Tahiti for his first time in 1891, his hopes were to find a paradise so he could create “pure” art. Unfortunately, most of the people of Tahiti were already dying from disease, it was not quite the paradise he was searching for. Despite that, he still painted the women at Tahiti. </p>
    <h3>Death</h3>
    <p>Paul was becoming weak from his drug addiction, and he was diagnosed with syphilis. He eventually died in early May, 1903.</p>
